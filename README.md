## Learning checklist
These are questions that an Orbs contributor should feel comfortable in answering to some level. This is not an exhaustive list but can help you in focusing your learning, especially if you are new to this world.

* Where is Bitcoin actually stored (explain blockchain as the agreed upon view of history)
* What is Proof of Work (PoW), what are its pros and cons
* What is Bitcoin mining (transactions, blocks, miner reward/fees, PoW)
* What is a smart contract made of and how is it run
* Why is Ethereum not suitable for consumer app token economies (gas price, transaction confirmation time)
* On which blockchain does the Orbs token live, and why
